# matrix-calculator

Calculate the determinant of a matrix or multiply 2 matrices together.

# big update no.1 5/12/2023

Added a user interface (UI) feature so that users don't have to convert their matrix into a JSON 2D array.
The UI is dynamic and can theoretically handle any number; the maximum I tested to display is 100.
More changes are coming soon!
